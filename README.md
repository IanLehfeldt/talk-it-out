# Talk It Out

Bobby Cordray and Ian Lehfeldt

Submission Instructions

1 - README.md

Create a README.md with the following headings:

Title of assignment (include purpose of assignment under heading)
Authors (include both of your names as bullet points under this heading)

2 - Submit via assignment app

Once you have completed the challenge, make sure to submit your completed project. Whoever was not the poster in the pair, make sure that you fork that repository and submit your work, too.

Good luck on your first pair challenge. Looking forward to seeing the results!

Hard Mode

Display the results of your javascript file and put it on the HTML View (We'll start calling this the DOM - Document Object Model). You can do this with Vanilla (plain old) Javascript or jQuery.

Pro Mode

Make things look great! Animate that number! Make it fade on in. Maybe show how the results got on the page with details? Oooh! Maybe show the keys and calculations and how you ended up with the result to a lay person. Make it snazzy!
